GCash Groups + ChibogPay: Shared Expenses Made Simple

Problem Statement

Sharing expenses is part of Filipino daily life — from barkada hangouts to groceries, shared apartments, and OFWs sending money home. But tracking who paid, who owes, and how to settle often leads to confusion, delays, or tension. Payments made through GCash are easily forgotten, causing incomplete settlements and awkward follow-ups.

Solution: GCash Groups + ChibogPay

GCash Groups allows users to create shared wallets and budgets for any purpose: trips, family expenses, rent, or remittances. Integrated with ChibogPay, it automatically tracks and splits food-related expenses, making group spending transparent and stress-free.

How It Works

Create a Group Wallet
Set up shared wallets for any group and add members by GCash number. Everyone can add expenses, view transactions, and attach receipts.

Expense Tracking and Auto-Split
Log expenses and split them equally or by custom ratios. The app displays balances and sends reminders to unsettled members.

ChibogPay Integration
Identifies food-related transactions and suggests automatic splitting for the group. Adds expenses to the shared log for one-tap settlement.

Family Group Mode
Designed for households or OFW families. Tracks all shared expenses with complete transparency, avoiding screenshot-based confusion.

Overseas Integration
OFWs can send funds directly to a family wallet and tag remittances by purpose. Families can upload receipts for clarity and trust.

Smart Budgets and Reminders
Set monthly budgets and receive insights when nearing spending limits. Promotes responsible group financial habits.
